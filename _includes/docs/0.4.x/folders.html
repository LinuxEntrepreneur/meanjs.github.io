  <p>
    The folder structure of your MEANJS application is shown in the following diagram:
  </p>
  <img src="{{ "/img/folders.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="MEANJS Folder Structure">
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> 
    The application root folder is shown here with the name <b>&lt;project-home&gt;</b> but yours will be named whatever you like depending on how you decide to identify your own application.
    Below is an explanation of what goes where and why.
  </p>
  <h2>&lt;project-home&gt;</h2>
  <p>
    This is the base of your application and holds the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Application configuration files;</li>
      <li>Hidden configuration files;</li>
      <li>A set of files used to build and start your application; and last but not least...</li>
      <li>The four main folders containing various code modules and libraries.</li>
    </ul> 
  </p>
  <h2>config</h2>
  <p>
    The config folder is where you house all the variable runtime configuration settings used by your application as well as a set of application helper functions, a.k.a. library or 'lib' modules.
  </p>
  <h2>modules</h2>
  <p>
    The modules folder is home to the main front-end AngularJS logic for the application. As you create various front-end capabilities and features in the application, each one will reside within this folder as a standalone module. As described in the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module">AngularJS Developer Guide</a>, "you can think of a module as a container for the different parts of your app".
  </p>
  <h2>public</h2>
  <p>
    This folder contains all the static front-end files used by the app to be served out. It includes elements built from your application's source as well as third-party external libraries required by your application.
  </p>
  <h2>scripts</h2>
  <p>
    This folder is home to various helper scripts used during development, administration and operation of your application.
